\section{Work This Far / Method and Results}

As outlined in \cref{sec:prelude} the study of redback pulsars has a multitude of science cases. However, the number of known redback is small, in searching for new redback pulsars allows for further inquiry into the nature of the subclass. The search usually begins with the selection of potential candidates from large-scale surveys carried out by optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observatories. Candiates are determined based on the flaring exhibted at these shorter wavelengths, then followed up using radio telescopes. Work to date has been to perform follow-up radio observations of Redback candidates to attempt to confirm radio emission and further compliment prior multiwavelength studies. \\ 

The \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) provides the most candidates as the related $\gamma$-ray emission are not subject to the same limitations as other detection methods \citep{ray_radio_2012}. Both candidates observed so far as part of this project are two Fermi candidates 1FGL J0523.5-2529 and 4FGL J2054.2+6904. 

\subsection{Observation Campaigns}

J0523 was the first observed candidate and was observed using the Ultra-Wide-Bandwidth, Low Frequency Reciver (UWL)\footnote{The UWL operates from 704 to 4032 MHz (40 - 7 cm)} on the Parkes Murriyang telescope in New South Wales. Published studies from \cite{strader_1fgl_2014} and \cite{halpern_luminous_2022} provide the orbital period, companion's radial velocity and distance measurements for the system. Each of these factors are important in determining the observation and search strategy. \\ 

For the pulsar to be detected the radio emission from the poles must be visible to the observer plane of view and the beam must be unobsured by the companion star. The orbital phase can be easily calculated from the periodic emission in the optical as demonstrated in \cref{fig: velocities} using the following equation, 

\begin{equation}
    \phi = \frac{t - T_0}{P_{\text{orb}}}
    \label{eq: orbital phase}
\end{equation}

At the time of writing 74\% of the orbital phase has been observed, with time approved to observe the remaining orbital phase if the pulsar is not detected. \\

In the case of J2054 less information is known with no accurate phase ephermeris avalible. A study by \cite{karpova_new_2023} reports the period, companion radius and distance. Over 8 hours of observations have been carried out using I-LOFAR. In this case the entire orbit needs to be covered and blindly searched for radio emission within expected parameter range of a Redback pulsar. Observations with X are planned to take place in the Summer of 2024 to try and determine the orbital phase based.

\subsection{Observation Data}

Observations from radio telescopes typically includes measurements of intensity, frequency, polarization and time. The data is usually stored in a time series format with the intensity and frequency measurements recorded at each time step. The data is usually stored in a  filterbanks (\texttt{.fil}) or .fits file format. The raw voltages are recorded and then processed into usable Stoke I files. 

\subsection{Search Strategy}

A zoo of pulsar software has been developed over the past decades to detect and time pulsars. One of the most commonly used softwares in the search for binary pulsars is PRESTO \citep{ransom_new_2001}. The search is carried out as illustrated in \cref{fig: presto-work-flow} and due to the large data volumes produced by modern telescopes, the search is carried out in a distributed manner on high performance computing clusters. \\ 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{figs/presto-work-flow.drawio.png}
    \caption{Outline of the PRESTO search strategy used to search for binary pulsars.}
    \label{fig: presto-work-flow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{RFI Removal}

The first step in nearly all radio observations is to remove Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from the observations data, this is usually caused by most modern technologies. This is important as artifical signals can mimic period signals associated with pulsar emission. Thus the data must mask frequencies or be clipped in the time domain. This project makes use of \texttt{rfifind} to remove such RFI. 

\texttt{rfifind} which is part of the PRESTO suite searches in both frequency and time domains. It analyses each channel for a specified time integration. Firstly the time domain statitics are computed which consists of the mean and stadared deviation of the values in each channel. For blocks where the mean value exceeds $4\sigma$ the block is flagged as RFI. If more than 30\% of the channel is flagged the entire channel is masked completely and replaced with a median constant bandpass value. An example of a mask produced by \texttt{rfifind} is shown in \cref{fig: rfifindexample}. 

\subsubsection{Incoherent Dedispersion}

Following the masking of all observation files the next step is to inchoherently dedisperse the data. This is done to remove the effects of dispersion caused by the interstellar medium as discussed in X. Failure to de-disperse data broadens potential pulse profiles and significantly reduces the signal to noise ratio. \Cref{fig: DM_pulse_example} shows an example of pulse dispersion. Inchoherent dedispersion is carried out by splitting the data into subbands and then shifting the data in time to correct for the desipersion. 


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{figs/DM_pulse_example.png}
    \caption{Example of a dispersion pulses of 128 ms pulsar B1356-60, which has a dispersion measure of 295 pc cm$^{-3}$. Figure from \citet[p.~20]{pulsar_handbook}.}
    \label{fig: DM_pulse_example}
\end{figure}

When correcting for dispersion it is important to consider the possible range of DMs that the pulsar could exhibit. The DM can be estimated through the use of density electron models such as X and X. However when dedisperseing the data it inherently induces smearing in the data. There are four types of smearing that need to be acounted for and characterized by the following equation, 

\begin{equation}
    \tau_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\tau_{\text{samp}}^2 + \tau_{\text{sub}}^2 + \tau_{\text{BW}}^2 + \tau_{\text{chan}}^2}
\end{equation}

    \label{fig: rfifindexample}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fast Fourier Transform}

The data is needs to be transformed into the frequency domain to search for periodic signals. This is commonly done with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in pulsar astronomy and computationally carried out using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). For a time series, $S_j$ of a given length of $N$ it is neccessary to convert the time series into the barycentric frame of reference. The barycentric frame if reference point is centered on the mass of the solar system. \\ The $k$th Fourier component of the time series is described in \citet[pp.~132-134]{pulsar_handbook} as,

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}_k = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} S_j \exp\left(-2\pi \sqrt{-1} \frac{jk}{N}\right)
\end{equation}

To complete this computation it requires $N^2$ floating point opearations. However, if a FFT operation is employed the number of operations is reduced to $N \log_2 N$ for a time series of length $N$. Since the time series data are real numbers symmetry can be exploited as the DFT is symmetric about the Nyquist frequency, $\nu_{\text{Nyq}} = 1/(2 t_{\text{samp}})$. For any frequencies higher than the $\nu_{\text{Nyq}}$ the complex conjucate is the same as the corresponding lower half of the frequency.

On the software side this is carried out with the \texttt{realfft} function in PRESTO. This result intakes the dedisperesed subbands and returns the power spectrum of the data. At this point the data is in a state to be searched for periodic signals.

\subsubsection{Accelration Searching}

Searching for binary pulsars requires a slightly different approach as the motion of the system causes the observed pulse frequency to smear across the Fourier bins (Cherry's paper), in turn this reduces the sensitivity of the search. A solution to this is to split up the search into smaller time intervals and assume that the radial velocity is a constant on this time scale. This can be shown to be a good approximation for $P_b/10$. \\ 
The spin frequency, $f_{\text{spin}}$ and the time of pulse emission, $t_{\text{pulse}}$ the pulsar's phase can be expressed as, $\phi_p = f_{\text{spin}}t_{\text{pulse}}$. Morever, the pulse time can be expressed as the time of arrival from the pulsar, $d(t_0)$, 

\begin{equation}
    t_{\text{pulse}} = t_0 - \frac{d(t_0)}{c}
\end{equation}

thus the phase can be expressed as,

\begin{align}
    \phi_p = & f_{\text{spin}}\left[ t_0 - \frac{d(t_0)}{c}\right] \\ 
    = & f_\text{spin} \left[ t_0 - \frac{a \sin i}{c} \sin \left[ \frac{2 \pi (t - t_{\text{asc}})}{P_B} \right] \right]
\end{align}

where $a$ is the semi-major axis, $i$ is the inclination angle, $t_{\text{asc}}$ is the time of ascending node and $P_B$ is the orbital period. A Taylor expansion can be used to $\sin x$ around $x = a$ such that, 

\begin{equation}
    \sin (x) \simeq   \sin (a) + \cos (a)(x - a) - \frac{\sin (a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 - \frac{\cos (a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \ldots
\end{equation}

Therefore the phase of the pulsar with a constant spin down rate can be expressed as, 

\begin{equation}
  \phi(t) = f^1 t_0 + \frac{\dot f}{2} (t - t_0)^2 + \frac{\ddot f}{6} (t - t_0)^3 + \ldots 
\end{equation}

Matching co-effcients between the the full Taylor expansion and the phase expression for the pulsar gives the following relation, $\dot f/2 = f_{\text{spin}} \frac{a \sin i}{c} A$. Where $A$ is represents all the terms in the expansion. The final simplified expression works out to be, 

\begin{equation}
    \dot f = f_\text{spin} \frac{4 \pi^2 a \sin i }{cP^2_B} \sin \left[ \frac{2 \pi (t - t_{\text{asc}})}{P_B} \right]
\end{equation}

Thus over a small enough time period spin-down is approximately constant.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{k_2 P_B}{2 \pi q} = a \sin i   
    \label{eq:constant_accel}
\end{equation}

Where $k_2$ is the radial velovity semi-amplitude, $P_B$ is the orbital period and $q$ is the mass ratio.

Searching is carried out using \texttt{accelsearch} which searches the FFT time series for period emissions by summing the highest Fourier frequency derivative. The number of bins that this signal is smeared is given by the acceleration parameter \citep{ransom_new_2001}, 

\begin{equation}
    z \simeq \dot f T^2_{\text{obs}}
\end{equation}

Where $T_{\text{obs}}$ is the length of the observation. The search is carried out over a range of accelerations which can be based on \cref{eq:constant_accel} if the physical quantities are known. A list of the known orbital parameters for the two candidates is given in \cref{tab:orbital-parameters} along with resultant z values.
