\section{Outline}

% Outline the background of your subject area including the key initial
% References \cite{jr:ashkin} and reference textbooks \cite{ob:bornwolf}. 
% Also include some of the more
% readable articles in popular science journals \cite{jr:dholakia},
% and, where appropriate, standard textbooks \cite{ob:hechtoptics}.

% The exact length of this section will depend on your subject area,
% but will generally not exceed a page and will be aimed at the 
% {\it general scientific reader}. 

\section{A prelude to Pulsars}

% In this section detail the main supporting references
% and articles \cite{jr:block} for your intended area of research
% and, most importantly, your critical evaluation of their
% relevance.  Also where your subject draws from multiple 
% disciplines, do not forget to include key reference from
% each discipline, even if they are relatively old \cite{jr:dammann}. 


% This is the main part of your review and is the part that
% will be of use to you when preparing for your thesis. Here try
% and identify as many of the key references as possible, and enter then
% into a {\tt BibTeX} file that you will use later. Remember that recording
% the page number, titles and details of these 
% key articles {\it now} will save you hours of
% searching through {\em Web-of-Knowledge} the day before your
% submit your thesis!

% This part should be written in standard scientific language, 
% aimed at the {\em experts in the field}. This is the main part of your first year report, and is 
% expected to be 10 pages in length.

\section{Open Questions}

% In this section you should detail your progress to date. The length of this section
% will depend on the type of research project you are undertaking.  

\section{Thesis Proposal}

% In this section, detail, as far as you are currently able, 
% your research plan for the second and third years of your PhD, 
% drawing from the key references \cite{jr:block} that you have highlighted in your review section. 
% Here, try and illustrate
% your proposal, as in Figure~\ref{fig:prism} which is taken from the
% same paper as the illustration references.
% %
%                       Here is how to inserted a centered
%                       pdf file, this one is actually
%                       out of Maple, but it will work for other
%                       figures out of Xfig, Idraw and Xgraph
%
% \begin{figure}[htb]     %Insert a figure as soon as possible
%         \begin{center}
%           \includegraphics[width=100mm]{OpticalSystem}
% \end{center}
% \caption{Here is the optical system from the same paper
%   as the reference drawn in {\tt xfig} and include to
%   shown how such a figure in included.}
% \label{fig:prism}                 % Reference label to the figure.
% \end{figure}

% At this stage it is {\em not} expected that this will be a fully-developed
% research proposal, but is your chance to show what you have extracted from the
% literature and how you see your own work will fit in. This section is
% not expected to exceed 2 pages.
 
\section{Summary}

% As short section highlighting the key aspect of your proposal.
% At this stage this may be a bit uncertain and will be subject
% to charge as the work progresses.
%            Now build the reference list

% \section{Risk Assessment}
