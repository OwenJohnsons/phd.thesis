	abstract = {Low-frequency (ν ≲ 150 MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal structure, mass ejections and space-weather conditions around the planets1. Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have detected only a single active flare star2 that is not representative of the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151—a member of the most common stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions3 (for example, Jupiter's decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151's slow rotation, but can originate in a sub-Alfvénic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations4-7 for interaction with an Earth-size planet in an approximately one- to five-day-long orbit.},

	abstract = {Low frequency radio wave scattering and refraction can have a dramatic effect on the observed size and position of radio sources in the solar corona. The scattering and refraction is thought to be due to fluctuations in electron density caused by turbulence. Hence, determining the true radio source size can provide information on the turbulence in coronal plasma. However, the lack of high spatial resolution radio interferometric observations at low frequencies, such as with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), has made it difficult to determine the true radio source size and level of radio wave scattering. Here we directly fit the visibilities of a LOFAR observation of a Type IIIb radio burst with an elliptical Gaussian to determine its source size and position. This circumvents the need to image the source and then de-convolve LOFAR's point spread function, which can introduce spurious effects to the source size and shape. For a burst at 34.76 MHz, we find full width at half maximum (FWHM) heights along the major and minor axes to be 18.8' ± 0.1' and 10.2' ± 0.1', respectively, at a plane of sky heliocentric distance of 1.75 R⊙. Our results suggest that the level of density fluctuations in the solar corona is the main cause of the scattering of radio waves, resulting in large source sizes. However, the magnitude of ɛ may be smaller than what has been previously derived in observations of radio wave scattering in tied-array images.},

	abstract = {We review both observational and theoretical aspects of the generation of auroral radio emissions at the outer planets, trying to organize the former in a coherent frame set by the latter. Important results have been obtained in the past few years on these radio emissions at the five magnetized planets, from the observations of Ulysses at Jupiter and of Wind and other Global Geospace Science spacecraft in Earth orbit, from the reanalysis of Voyager data about Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, from ground-based high frequency-time resolution and full polarization measurements, and from pioneering multispectral observations of the Jovian and Saturnian aurorae (radio/UV/IR). In parallel, considerable progress has been made in their generation theory (Cyclotron-Maser operating in small-scale, laminar, hot-plasma-dominated radio source structures), mostly on the basis of in situ observations of terrestrial radio sources. Particle acceleration and precipitation is also better documented, thanks to in situ measurements in the Earth auroral zones and to multispectral studies of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, the modeling of the planetary magnetic field and magnetospheric plasma at these two planets has also been considerably improved. To organize the wealth of observational results within a coherent theoretical frame, we emphasize unresolved questions (e.g., planetary radio bursts generation) and contradictions and propose ways to answer them. Our ability, already significant, to perform remote sensing of magnetoplasmas at the giant planets and, hopefully, at other distant radio sources (solar, stellar) in the near future, depends on the good understanding of the physical processes underlying the generation of auroral electromagnetic emissions. The question of the existence of exoplanetary radio emissions and the possibility to detect and study them is briefly discussed.},
