# PhD Thesis 

The purpose of this repository is to keep a well-documented and stored version of my PhD thesis completed at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Evan Keane in the school of physics. This PhD was jointly funded by both the TCD school of physics and the Breakthrough Listen which operate out of the University of Oxford.

This repository also hosts some other smaller 'foundational' documents such as a literature review and progress reports. 

For any information about my research or otherwise please contact me via my email at ojohnson@tcd.ie
